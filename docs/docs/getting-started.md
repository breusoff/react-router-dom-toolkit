## Installation

React Router Dom Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```shell
npm i react-router-dom-toolkit
```

or

```shell
yarn add react-router-dom-toolkit
```

## Dependencies

Let's also install dependencies used by this package, then we can move forward with starting to write some code.

The libraries we will install now are **react-router-dom**. If you already have these libraries installed and at the latest version, you are done here!

```shell
npm i react-router-dom
```

or

```shell
yarn add react-router-dom
```
